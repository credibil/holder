# Credibil Wallet Demonstration Service

This crate provides a simple integrated Verifiable Credential Issuer and Verifier service over HTTP. It can only issue and verify a couple of hard-coded credentials and is intended to be used simply to test and demonstrate the example `tauri-wallet` and `crux-wallet` applications in this repository.

See the README in the respective wallet examples for how to get started demonstrating the wallet using this service.

For a more full-featured example of an issuance service, see the `examples/issuer` folder in the [Credibil VC repository](https://github.com/credibil/vc).

For a more full-featured example of a verifier service, see the `examples/verifier` folder in the [Credibil VC repository](https://github.com/credibil/vc).
