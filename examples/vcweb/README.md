# Mock Web Application for Issuer and Verifier

This crate provides a simple web application to demonstrate both Verifiable Credential issuance and verification. It works with the `vcservice` example crate as its back-end. It can only issue and verify a couple of hard-coded credentials and is intended to be used simply to test and demonstrate the example `tauri-wallet` and `crux-wallet` applications in this repository.

See the README in the respective wallet examples for how to get started demonstrating the wallet using this application.
